# Columbo

## About

Columbo is a suite of tools, currently targeted at developers, to facilitate code generation from a model.

Essentially, this is a low-code framework for defining data structures, API's, and interfaces from a declarative model, acting as the source of truth. This alleviates several pain points in the development cycle of services and data structures which evolve over time...

 1. Backwards-compatible changes
 2. Schema consistency between API's and data structures

More to come...
